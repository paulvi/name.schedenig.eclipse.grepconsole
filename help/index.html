		<h2>Overview</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		Developers usually have their programs write log and debug information to
		the standard output during coding and testing. This results in a lot of text 
		being printed to Eclipse's console view, often more than can be easily 
		surveyed. Since at any given time, only a small part of this information is 
		of primary interest to the developer, a tool which highlights specific lines 
		or words can significantly increase the readability of this output.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Grep Console allows you to define a series of regular expressions which will 
		be tested against the console output. Each expression matching a line will 
		affect the style of either the entire line or parts of it. For example, 
		error messages could be set to show up with a red background, or integer 
		values showing the state of a certain variable could be rendered in bold 
		font. 
	</p>
	
  <a name="whats-new">
		<h2>What's New</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		The following features have been added to Grep Console during the 3.x
		version branch:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Folders (3.0)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Grep expressions can now be arranged in folders for better overview.
				Each folder can be enabled or disabled as a whole.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Styles (3.0)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Highlighting settings are now configured separately from the grep
				expressions that use them. These styles can be shared among multiple
				grep expressions.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Import/Export (3.0)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Grep expressions and styles can now be exported to XML files for sharing
				or transfer to other Eclipse workspaces.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Launch Configuration Support (3.0)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Grep folders and expressions are configured globally, but they can
				be individually enabled or disabled for each launch configuration.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Grep View (3.0)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep View displays a console like text field that shows only a
				subset of <emph>filtered</emph> expressions from the standard Eclipse
				console.
			</p>
		</dd>
	
		
    <dt>"Unless" expressions (3.1)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				An optional second regular expression can be configure for each item to
				prevent the item from being considered a match for certain strings even
				if the main expression matches.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Case sensitivity (3.1)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Case sensitivity of grep expressions can now easily be toggled via a
				checkbox.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Jump to line (3.1)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep View context menu now provides an action for jumping to the
				selected line in the original console.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Support for more run configurations (3.1)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep Console tab is now available for JUnit, Eclipse RCP and CDT
				launch configurations.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Multiple matches per line (3.2)</dt>

				the last match in a line was recognised.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Links (3.2)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Expressions and capture groups may now be assigned links. These links
				will be executed when the matched substring is clicked on while the
				CTRL key is pressed. Different link types can be used to open text files
				or Java types in the Eclipse editor, open URLs in a browser or execute
				scripts and system commands.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Pattern help (3.2)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The expression dialogue now contains a web link to the Java Pattern API
				documentation (explaining the regular expression syntax).
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Autostart links (3.3)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Items can specify autostart links, which will open automatically
				whenever a line matching the item's regular expression is written to the
				console. Autostart links require the Grep View to work.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Line rewriting (3.3)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Lines shown in the Grep View can be completely rewritten. Rewritten
				lines can include any parts of the original line and may have different
				styles and links than the original console output.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Quick expressions (3.4)</dt>

				can be used in link pattern strings.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Configurable colours in the Grep View (3.4)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				By default, the Grep View now uses the same colours as the Eclipse
				console. These colours can be changed in the preferences.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Configurable link modifier key (3.4)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				On Mac systems, the link modifier key is now Command instead of Ctrl.
				The modifier key can be changed in the preferences.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>GUI improvements (3.5)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Various user interface details were changed to be consistent with the

  <a name="installation">
		<h2>Installation</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		Grep Console requires Java 6 and Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) or higher.
	</p>

	<p>	
		To install Grep Console from the Update Site, select <emph>Help/Software
		Updates/Available Software</emph> from your Eclipse menu and click
		<emph>Add Site</emph> to add the following URL:
	</p>
	
	<blockquote>http://eclipse.schedenig.name</blockquote>

	<p>
		You can now open the site in the list of available software, check
		Grep Console and click <emph>Install</emph> to begin the installation
		process. Grep Console depends on the Popup Notifications plug-in, which will
		be automatically installed from the same location..
	</p>

  <a name="updating">
		<h2>Updating</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		If you are updating from a 2.x version of Grep Console, your old settings
		will automatically be imported.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The package and ID names have changed in version 3. For this reason, Eclipse
		will not automatically find updates for Grep Console 2, and after installing
		the new version 3, the old version 2 will still be installed as well. It is
		recommended that you uninstall the old version, and Grep Console 3 will show
		a dialogue to remind you to do this.
	</p>

  <a name="console-actions">
		<h2>Console Actions</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		Grep Console contributes two actions to Eclipse's console views.
		Both carry the Grep Console icon.
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt><img src="img/logo_16.png" /> Manage expressions</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				This actions is available via the console's toolbar. It opens
				a dialogue for <a href="#managing-grep-expressions">managing grep
				expressions</a> and <a href="#managing-styles">styles</a>. The
				expressions and styles modified via the dialogue are affected globally,
				but the settings for enabling or disabling expressions and showing
				them in the Grep View are specific to the current launch configuration.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt><img src="img/logo_16.png" /> Add expression</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				This action can be found in the console's right click context menu.
				It is only available if text has been selected in the console.
				It can be used to create a new grep expression from the selected text.
				Selecting it opens a a sub menu listing the existing folders.
				These entries can be used to select the target folder for the newly
				created expression. A separate entry is available for creating a new
				folder.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Selecting a folder takes you directly to the 
				<a href="#editing-grep-expressions">edit expression dialogue</a>.
				Confirming the settings in this dialogue creates the new expression.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
  <a name="managing-grep-expressions">
		<h2>Managing Grep Expressions</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This dialogue allows you to add, edit and delete grep expressions.
		Expressions can be arranged in folders, and can be enabled or disabled 
		for styling, Grep View output and notifications either individually or via
		their folders.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The dialogue can be opened from the console, the Grep View, a launch
		configuration or Eclipse's preferences dialogue. Depending on how the
		dialogue
		was opened, settings controlling whether items are enabled, disabled, shown
		in the Grep View and trigger notifications may refer to the current launch
		configuration or the global defaults. Folders and grep expressions
		themselves are always stored globally and changing them will affect all
		launch configurations equally. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Each expression must belong to a folder, and folders can only contain
		expressions (that is, folders cannot be nested). The dialogue shows all
		available folders and expressions as a tree structure.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_manage_expressions.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Threeo columns on the right side of the item tree control which items are
		enabled for highlighting, which items are shown in the Grep View and which
		items may trigger notifications:
	</p>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/checkbox_on.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is enabled for highlighting.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/checkbox_off.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is disabled for highlighting.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/checkbox_on_inherited.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is enabled for highlighting (inherited from the default
				settings).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/checkbox_off_inherited.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is disabled for highlighting (inherited from the default
				settings).</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/filter_on.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is shown in the Grep View.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/filter_off.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is not shown in the Grep View.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/filter_on_inherited.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is shown in the Grep View (inherited from the
				default settings).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/filter_off_inherited.png" /></td>
			<td>The item is not shown in the Grep View (inherited from
				the default settings).</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/notification_on.png" /></td>
			<td>The item may trigger notifications.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/notification_off.png" /></td>
			<td>The item may not trigger notifications.</td>

			<td>The item may not trigger notifications (inherited from
				the default settings).</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>

			<td>The item may contribute statistics.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="img/statistics_off.png" /></td>
			<td>The item may not contribute statistics.</td>

	</table>
	
	<p>
		Clicking any of these icons will cycle through the available settings in
		the order <emph>inherited</emph>/<emph>enabled</emph>/<emph>disabled</emph>.
		Nested items can only effectively be enabled if the group to which they
		belong is enabled as well. If an item's parent group is disabled, the item's
		corresponding icon is greyed out, signalling that its setting is
		ineffective.
		The <emph>inherited</emph> setting is only available if a launch
		configuration is associated with the dialogue. Otherwise, the items' default
		settings are edited directly via these icons.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For highlighting, Grep View output and notifications, folders and
		expressions are evaluated in the order shown in this list. Items can be
		reordered via drag and drop. Right clicking an item opens a context menu
		which can be used to cut, copy and paste items. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The dialogue provides the following actions:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Add folder</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Creates a new folder. Opens the
				<a href="#editing-folders">edit folder dialogue</a>.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Add expression</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Creates a new grep expression in the currently selected folder.
				Opens the
				<a href="#editing-grep-expressions">edit expression dialogue</a>.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Edit</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Edits the currently selected folder or grep expression via the
				matching dialogue. This action can also be triggered by double clicking
				an item in the tree.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Remove</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Deletes the currently selected folder or grep expression. This
				action can also be triggered by pressing the <emph>del</emph> key.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Load</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Loads folders and grep expressions from a file and adds them to
				the current tree.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Save selected</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Saves the currently selected folders and grep expressions to a file.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Save all</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Saves all folders and grep expressions to a file.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>
		Right clicking an item in the tree opens a context menu providing
		cut/copy/paste actions. Items can also be rearranged via drag and drop.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A panel below the tree displays a live preview of the configured
		expressions. The text content of the preview is taken from the active
		console, if available. Otherwise, a default text is displayed. The text can
		be freely edited, and the right click context menu provides actions to load
		and save the default text. This context menu also includes an action to
		create a new grep expression from the text currently selected in the
		preview. Also, the colour scheme for the preview can be changed from the
		one used by the Eclipse console to the one used by the Grep View.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All settings edited in this dialogue are only saved after you click the
		<emph>OK</emph> button. Clicking <emph>Cancel</emph> instead will discard
		all changes.
	</p>
	
  <a name="editing-folders">
		<h2>Editing Folders</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This dialogue allows the editing of a folder.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_folder.png" />
	</p>

	<p>
		The folder's name can be changed via the text field. Check boxes below
		the text field can be used to set the default values for whether the
		folder is enabled for highlighting, for output to the Grep View and for
		triggering notifications.
	</p>
	
  <a name="editing-grep-expressions">
		<h2>Editing Grep Expressions</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This dialogue allows the editing of a grep expression.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_expression_general.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The content of the dialogue is spread across a number of tabs. At the top
		of the dialogue, the regular expression can be viewed and edited regardless
		of the selected tab. If the entered
		expression is invalid, it is shown in red font, and the tool tip (displayed
		when the mouse cursor hovers over the text field for a few seconds) shows
		an error message.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As with the expressions dialogue, all settings edited in this dialogue are only
		saved after you click the <emph>OK</emph> button. Clicking
		<emph>Cancel</emph> instead will discard all changes.
	</p>
	
	<a name="editing-grep-expressions-general">
		<h3>General</h3>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		The top section of this tab contains a series of text fields. Here, an
		optional name for the expression can be configured, and a quick and an
		"unless" expression can be set.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a quick expression has been set for an item, that expression is tested
		first, and only if it matches is the main expression tested. If a quick
		expression is specified, the main expression is evaluated on the entire
		line of text, disregarding the length limits configured in the preferences.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a quick expression is configured and the expression is
		matched by a line, the item is not considered a match for the line, even if
		the main expression matches.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A checkbox can be used to specify whether the regular expressions should be
		treated case sensitively. By default, case sensitivity is turned on. The
		<emph>Pattern help</emph> line opens a browser to show the regular
		expression help page from the Java API documentation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In the <emph>Defaults</emph> section, checkboxes can be used to configure
		whether lines matching the specified expression should be styled in the
		console, shown in the Grep View, and be used to trigger notifications by
		default. These defaults can be overridden by individual settings for each
		launch configuration. 
	</p>
	
	<a name="editing-grep-expressions-styles-links">
		<h3>Styles &amp; Links</h3>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This tab configures the visual style of lines matched by the regular
		expression, along with clickable links that may be placed in the console
		output.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_expression_styles_links.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The left table below the header section shows a list of all available
		capture groups and their assigned styles and link actions. Each expression always
		has at least one capture group labeled <emph>Whole line</emph> which can be
		used to assign a style to an entire line of matching text. For each capture
		group in the regular expression (defined by surrounding part of the
		expression with parantheses), an additional entry is provided, allowing you
		to assign styles specifically to the corresponding parts of matching lines.
		Please refer to the official
		<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" target="_blank">Java API documentation</a>
		for the <code>Pattern</code> class for details on capture groups and
		advanced regular expressions. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Link actions can be edited by double clicking the corresponding cell in the
		rightmost column, which will open the
		<a href="#editing-links">action dialogue</a>. Right clicking on a link
		cell will show a context menu for copying and pasting actions. In the Eclipse
		console and Grep View, links are available when holding down the link
		modifier key, which can be configured in the preferences and defaults to
		Ctrl on Windows and Linux and to Command on Mac systems.
		This will turn the mouse cursor into a link cursor when hovering over a
		link. Left clicking will open the link and perform the configured action.
	</p>

	<p>
		Groups may be renamed by double clicking their label in the left column.
		Named columns can be accessed by their name in action parameters (see below).
		The tooltip hint for a group will always display the original label.
	</p>

	<p>
		The table to the right provides a list of all available styles. Each style
		is coupled with a small preview icon displaying its foreground and
		background colours. Selecting a style shows a detailed preview below the
		table. The first item in the table is the null style, which can be used to
		assign no style at all to a group.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The currently selected style can be assigned to the currently selected
		group (in the left table) by double clicking the style or via the
		<emph>Assign</emph> button. Additional buttons for style management are
		available and correspond to their counterparts in the
		<a href="#managing-styles">styles dialogue</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a rewrite expression has been specified on the <emph>Grep View</emph>
		tab, the left table also includes
		assignments for the entire rewritten line and for any additional groups that
		may have been specified in the expression. These also can be assigned styles
		and link actions.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Below the styles and links table, a checkbox controls whether any style that
		may already be set on the original console line should be removed before
		applying Grep Console's styles. For example, Eclipse by default applies
		specific styles to stderr output and stack traces. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A preview in the lower left area of the dialogue provides a preview of the
		current expression's highlighting settings. Like the preview field in the
		<a href="#managing-grep-expressions">expressions dialogue</a>, it can be
		edited and provides a right click context menu to load and save the default
		preview text. This menu also provides an action to use the current selection
		in the preview text field as the item's regular expression.
	</p>
	
	
	<a name="editing-grep-expressions-grep-view">
		<h3>Grep View</h3>
	</a>

	<p>
		This tab configures how lines matching the specified expression are
		displayed in the Grep View. This only applies if the item has been enabled
		for Grep View output (via the default settings on the <emph>General</emph>
		tab and/or any launch configuration specific settings).

	</p>
	
	<p>
		If the expression is used to show lines in the Grep View, a rewrite
		expression can be specified to change the line that is shown in the Grep
		View. The expression can contain any regular strings. Additionally, index
		expressions in curly braces ("{0}, "{1}", "{2}, etc.) can be used to include
		parts from the original line in the rewritten line. "{0}" is replaced with
		the entire original line, while higher numbers refer to the corresponding
		capture groups in the regular expression, if any have been specified. Like
		in regular expressions, parantheses ('(' and ')') can be used to denote
		groups, which then can be assigned styles and link actions on the
		<emph>Styles and Links</emph> tab. Rewritten
		lines must be styled specifically and are not subject to the standard styles
		assigned to lines in the original console and all non-rewritten lines in the
		Grep View. The backslash acts as an escape character: "\(" outputs an
		opening paranthesis instead of starting a new group. "\\" can be used to
		include the backslash character in the output.
	</p>
	
	<a name="editing-grep-expressions-notifications">
		<h3>Notifications</h3>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		A matched line of text may trigger a number of notifications, which can be
		configured in this tab.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_expression_notifications.png" />
	</p>
	
	<h4>Popup notification:</h4>
	
	<p>
		Popup notifications display a popup window on the screen when a console line
		is matched. The title and message texts for the popup can be configured
		using <a href="#pattern-strings">pattern strings</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		By default, a click on the popup window will active the Eclipse window. A
		link action can be configured to specify a different behaviour when the
		popup is clicked.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Sound notification:</h4>
	
	<p>
		A sound file can be selected to play whenever a console line matches the
		specified expression. Sound files of types WAV, AIF and AU are supported.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Autostart action:</h4>
	
	<p>
		If an autostart action is configured, the action will be executed
		automatically as soon as a line matching the regular expression is detected.
	</p>
	
	<a name="editing-grep-expressions-statistics">
		<h3>Statistics</h3>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		The occurences of an expression item can be tracked and displayed in the
		<a href="#statistics-view">Statistics View</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_expression_statistics.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a counter label is specified, the number of occurrences of the expression
		item will be counted and displayed in the statistics view under the
		specified label.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a value label is specified, the statistics view will have an entry which
		always displays the content of the latest occurence of the expression under
		the specified label. By default, the entire match is displayed, but a
		pattern can be specified to rewrite the line similar to a
		<a href="#editing-grep-expressions-grep-view">rewrite expression</a>
		for the Grep View.
	</p>
	
  <a name="pattern-strings">
		<h2>Pattern Strings</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		On several occasions, Grep Console uses <emph>patterns</emph> to allow the
		user to configure strings which dynamically include values from the matched
		text or from the Eclipse configuration. Aa pattern is a string
		that may contain certain parameters which will be automatically replaced
		with dynamic values at runtime. This can for example be used
		to create a link action that opens a URL that is shown in the console. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The following parameters are available in pattern fields:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>{line}</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The whole line text string of the matched line.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>{match}</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The whole matched text.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>{1}, {2},…</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The text of the specified capture group.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>{group}</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The text of the matched capture group. Only available in context where
				there is a specific capture group to which the pattern string refers.
				For example, in a link action, the parameter refers to the expression
				item to which the link is attached. If the link was attached to the
				first capture group, then <tt>{group}</tt> is equivalent to
				<tt>{1}</tt>.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>{<emph>groupname</emph>}</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Instead of the group index, its name (if set) can be used as well.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>{eclipse:<emph>variablename</emph>}</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Provides access to the Eclipse variables also used in the arguments tab
				of run configurations. Note that these variable names are case sensitive
				and are usually spelled in uppercase letters, even though the run
				configuration variable dialogue lists them in lowercase.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For example, <tt>{eclipse:PROJECT_LOC}</tt> is the full path to the 
				project's root directory.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
  <a name="editing-actions">
		<h2>Editing Actions</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This dialogue is used to edit a action. Most actions are assigned to links.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_link.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A combo box is used to switch between no action and the available action types.
		The dialogue will display different fields depending on the selected type.
		Most of these fields will store <a href="#pattern=strings">pattern strings</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The following action types are currently supported:
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>File</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This type of action opens a file in an Eclipse editor. The file name (a
		file system path), an optional base directory, line number offset
		(column) can be specified. All fields are patterns. If no base directory
		is specified, the project's root directory will be used. 
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Java type</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This type of action opens a Java type in an Eclipse editor. The type is
		taken from the project which is bound to the launch configuration that
		started the console. The type name, an optional line number and an optional
		offset (column) can be specified. All fields are patterns. 
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>URL</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Opens a URL, either in an internal browser or via an external program
		chosen by the system depending on the URL - typically the system browser,
		but different applications may be configured for specific URLs or file
		extensions. The URL field is a pattern. If an URL without a protocol is
		encountered, "http://" will be prefixed automatically.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Command</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Executes a system (shell) command. The command and working directory can
		be specified. If no working directory is set, the current working directory
		of Eclipse is used. Both fields are patterns. 
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Script</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Execute a script via the Java Scripting API. The script language and code
		can be specified. The language must be registered in the Java Scripting API.
		A drop down list shows all available language names (several different names
		for the same langage may be displayed).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When the script is executed, several variables are available in the code:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>matchResult</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/MatchResult.html" target="_blank">MatchResult</a>
				instance for the link match.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>groups</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				An array containing the capture group strings. The first element will
				be the string for the whole match. Remaining elements refer to the
				item's capture groups.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>wholeLine</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The whole line text string of the matched line.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>matchedGroup</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The index of the capture group associated with the link.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
		
  <a name="managing-styles">
		<h2>Managing Styles</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This dialogue can be used to create, edit and delete styles.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_manage_styles.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The dialogue lists all currently available styles by name, each prefixed with
		a preview icon showing its foreground and background colours. A preview 
		label below the list shows a detailed preview of the currently selected
		style. The tooltip label displayed when the mouse cursor hovers over an
		item for a few seconds lists the grep expressions which currently use the
		respective style.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <emph>New</emph> button can be used to add a new style. Likewise, the
		<emph>Edit</emph> button is used to edit the currently selected style. This
		action is also available by double clicking a style in the list. Both
		actions open the <a href="#editing-styles">edit style</a> dialogue.
		The <emph>Delete</emph> button can be used to delete the selected style.
		Alternatively, the delete key can be usd in the list. If the selected style
		is still used by one or more grep expressions, a warning dialogue listing the
		connected expressions is displayed before the style is deleted.
	</p>

	<p>
		All settings edited in this dialogue are only saved after you click the
		<emph>OK</emph> button. Clicking <emph>Cancel</emph> instead will discard
		all changes.
	</p>

  <a name="editing-styles">
		<h2>Editing Styles</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This dialogue is used to edit a single style.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_edit_style.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A text field at the top of the dialogue controls the style's name. Checkbox
		can be used to toggle bold and italic font settings for the style.
		Foreground and background colours, underlines and strikethrough lines as
		well as borders can be controlled via individual lines where a checkbox
		is used to enable or disable the respective settings an a text field is
		provided to enter the hexadecimal code of the desired colour. A button to
		the right of the text field shows a preview of the colour and can be clicked
		to select a new colour via the system's colour dialogue.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		An preview label below the dialogue's controls shows a live preview
		of the selected settings. The top and bottom line of the preview are
		unstyled, while the centre line shows a preview of the current style
		settings.
	</p>

  <a name="launch-configurations">
		<h2>Launch Configurations</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		Launch configurations now feature a <emph>Grep Console</emph> tab.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_launch_config.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The tree view in a launch configuration only allows changing the
		highlighting, Grep View and notification settings for the displayed items
		(via the icons in the two columns on the right side of the view). These
		settings are specific to the launch configuration. Each option can be set to
		<emph>inherit</emph>, in which case the global default setting is used for
		the corresponding item.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <emph>Configure expressions</emph> button below the view opens the
		<a href="#managing-grep-expressions">Manage expressions dialogue</a> for
		editing the grep folders and expressions. Keep in mind that these
		items are stored globally and that changing them will affect all launch
		configurations. 
	</p>
	
  <a name="preferences">
		<h2>Preferences</h2>
	</a>

	<p>
		Eclipse's preference dialogue includes a section labeled
		<emph>Grep Console</emph>.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_preferences.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The content of this section is exactly the same as that of the
		<a href="#managing-grep-expressions">Manage expressions</a> and
		<a href="#managing-grep-styles">Managing styles</a> dialogues.
	</p>

	<h3>Settings</h3>
	
	<p>
		The preference section also has a sub section labeled <emph>Settings</emph>.
		Here you can configure global options for Grep Console.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_preferences_settings.png" />
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Match length configurations affect the way regular expressions are tested
		against strings. The configured match lengths specify the maximum length
		of a line of text that is tested against a regular expression when
		determining the matching expressions for styling lines or showing them
		in the Grep View, respectively. If a line is longer than the specified
		limit, only its beginning is tested against the regular expressions (but
		when matched, the entire line is still displayed and styled). A value of 0
		means that no limit is specified and regular expressions are always tested
		against the entire line regardless of its length. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Limiting the match length can be useful because testing a large number of
		long lines can have a significant performance impact, especially when using
		the Grep View. If your Eclipse workbench becomes slow or even hangs when you
		have long lines in your console, try shortening the match length limites.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The text and background colours for the Grep View can be configured as well.
		If they are not set, they default to the same colours used by the Eclipse
		console.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The modifier key used to click links in the console and Grep View can be
		changed. By default, Ctrl is used on Windows and Linux, while Mac systems
		default to the Command key.
	</p>

	<p>
		For popup notifications, the foreground and background colours and the title
		and message fonts can be configured. If they are not set, the system's
		tooltip colours and Eclipse's standard fonts are used as defaults.
	</p>
		
  <a name="grep-view">
		<h2>Grep View</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		The Grep View is used to display a subset of <emph>filtered</emph>
		expressions for a console. The view applies the same highlighting settings
		to these lines that are also used in the main console. Each console in the
		console view has a corresponding console in the Grep View.
	</p>

	<p>
		Right-clicking a line in the Grep View opens a context menu that can be used
		to jump to the same line in the original console, scrolling it into view if
		necessary.
	</p>
	
	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_grep_view.png" />
	</p>

	<p>
		The following actions are available in the Grep View:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt><img src="img/lock_co.gif" /> Scroll Lock</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Similar to the standard action from Eclipse's console view. Stops the
				console from auto scrolling when new text is added.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt><img src="img/writeout_co.gif" /> Linked to Console</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Keeps the currently displayed consoles of the Grep View and Eclipse's
				console view in sync. When the selected console in one of these views
				changes, the other view automatically switches to the matching console
				as well.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt><img src="img/console_view.gif" /> Display Selected Console</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Similar to the standard action from Eclipse's console view. Selects the
				currently displayed console.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt><img src="img/logo_16.png" /> Manage expressions</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Just as the same action in the main console, this opens
				a dialogue for <a href="#managing-grep-expressions">managing grep
				expressions</a> and <a href="#managing-styles">styles</a>. The
				expressions and styles modified via the dialogue are affected globally,
				but the settings for enabling or disabling expressions, showing
				them in the Grep View and triggering notifications are specific to the
				current launch configuration.
			</p>
		</dd> 
	</dl>

  <a name="statistics-view">
		<h2>Statistics View</h2>
	</a>
	
	<p>
		The statistics view displays all the statistics information grabbed by
		the <a href="#editing-grep-expressions-statistics">statistics settings</a>
		of enabled expression items.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<img src="img/screen_statistics_view.png" />

	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt><img src="img/writeout_co.gif" /> Linked to Console</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Keeps the currently displayed consoles of the Grep View and Eclipse's

				changes, the other view automatically switches to the matching console
				as well.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt><img src="img/console_view.gif" /> Display Selected Console</dt>
