	<dl>
		<dt>GUI improvements</dt>
		
		<dd>

		</dd>
		
		<td>Terminology changes</td>
		
		<dd>

		<dt>Popup notifications</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Expressions can now trigger popup notifications which display messages
				based on the matched console lines even when Eclipse is not currently
				the active window. An action which is triggered when the user clicks the
				popup can be configured.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Sound notifications</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Expressions can now play sounds when they are matched.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Version 3.4</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Quick expressions</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Expression items may now have a quick expression which is tested before
				the main expression is evaluated.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Base paths for file links</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				A base path for relative file links can now be specified. By default,
				the project's root directory is used.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>http:// prefix for URL links</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				URLs without a schema prefix can now be used in URL links. They will
				automatically be prefixed with "http://".
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Offsets for file and Java links</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				For file and Java links, an optional character offset can be specified
				to position the cursor at a specific column in the editor.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Eclipse variables in link pattern fields</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Pattern strings in link configurations can reference use Eclipse
				variables (as used in the arguments tab of the launch configuration
				dialogue).
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Custom names for expression groups</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Groups of expression items can now be assigned custom names. These names
				can be used in link pattern strings.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Configurable colours in the Grep View</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				By default, the Grep View now uses the same colours as the Eclipse
				console. These colours can be changed in the preferences.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Configurable link modifier key</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				On Mac systems, the link modifier key is now Command instead of Ctrl.
				The modifier key can be changed in the preferences.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Version 3.3</h2>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Autostart links</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Items can specify autostart links, which will open automatically
				whenever a line matching the item's regular expression is written to the
				console. Autostart links require the Grep View to work.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Line rewriting</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Lines filtered to the Grep View can be completely rewritten. Rewritten
				lines can include any parts of the original line and may have different
				styles and links than the original console output.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Version 3.2</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Multiple matches per line</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Expressions may now match multiple substrings per line. Previously, only
				the last match in a line was recognised.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Links</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Expressions and capture groups may now be assigned links. These links
				will be executed when the matched substring is clicked on while the
				CTRL key is pressed. Different link types can be used to open text files
				or Java types in the Eclipse editor, open URLs in a browser or execute
				scripts and system commands.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Pattern help</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The expression dialog now contains a web link to the Java Pattern API
				documentation (explaining the regular expression syntax).
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
		
	<h2>Version 3.1</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>"Unless" expression</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				An optional second regular expression can be configure for each item to
				prevent the item from being considered a match for certain strings even
				if the main expression matches.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Case sensitivity flag<dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Case sensitivity of grep expressions can now easily be toggled via a
				checkbox.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Jump to line</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep View context menu now provides an action for jumping to the
				selected line in the original console.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Support for more run configurations</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep Console tab is now available for JUnit, Eclipse RCP and CDT
				launch configurations. 
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
		
	<h2>Version 3.0</h2>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>New ID</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep Console bundles and packages have new IDs. That means that if
				you had an old version of Grep Console installed, it was not replaced
				when you installed 3.0. In this case, it is recommended that you
				uninstall your old version manually. Your old settings are automatically
				imported by Grep Console 3.0. 
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Folders</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Grep expressions can now be arranged in folders for better overview.
				Each folder can be enabled or disabled as a whole.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Styles</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Highlighting settings are now configured separately from the grep
				expressions that use them. These styles can be shared among multiple
				grep expressions.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Import/Export</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Grep expressions and styles can now be exported to XML files for sharing
				or transfer to other Eclipse workspaces.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Launch Configuration Support</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				Grep folders and expressions are configured globally, but they can
				be individually enabled or disabled for each launch configuration.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Grep View</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The Grep View displays a console like text field that shows only a
				subset of <emph>filtered</emph> expressions from the standard Eclipse
				console.
			</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Match length settings (3.0.1)</dt>
		
		<dd>
			<p>
				The length of string lines that are tested with the regular expression
				matchers may be configured in the preferences. This became necessary as
				very long lines could have a significant performance impact when tested
				for the Grep View.
			</p>
		</dd>
